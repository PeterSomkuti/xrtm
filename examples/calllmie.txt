lmie is a linearized Mie scattering code which can be found along with
documentation at:

http://reef.atmos.colostate.edu/~gregm/lmie/


The following is the calllmie command used to calculate the aerosol scattering
properties found in the file 2_250000_miam00.gc used in the xrtm example case.
It is for scattering by the accumulation mode mineral dust described by
d'Almeida, 1991 at 2.25 um except with an effective variance of 0.2.
